Dropcatching is the process of bidding on expiring domain names in hopes that the dropcatching service can successfully snipe the domain on your behalf as soon as it drops.

All of the popular dropcatching services are competing and the one with the most resources allocated to any particular name will most likely win the snipe.

It definitely helps to shop around for the best prices and take advantage of many of the free, downloadable lists that each dropcatching service provides. Using tools like [Dropfilter](https://github.com/crock/dropfilter), you can easily filter these huge lists based on customizable criteria.
