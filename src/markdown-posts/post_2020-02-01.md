Last week, I created and launched possibly the coolest Discord bot command to have ever been created and it's exclusive to my community, [Domaincord](https://domaincord.com/discord).

It is a direct port of my open-source Python command-line program (cli) to a Discord bot command built with the [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org) library for [Node.js](nodejs.org).  Both the bot command and the cli application filter daily expiring domain name drop lists based on configurable criteria that the user specifies in the form of a JSON string.

For the non-tech savvy users of my tool, I even created a [web-based configuration generator](https://domaincord.com/dropfilter/config) to generate properly formatted configurations for both the bot command and the cli application.
